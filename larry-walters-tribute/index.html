      <h1 class="title">That's Right</h1>
      <h2 class="title">Lawn. Chair. Pilot.</h2>
      <p>
        It's 1982 in Los Angeles, California. The internet consists of a booklet of email addresses, cellphones look and feel like bricks, and a 19 inch colour TV cost about $1700 today's dollars. So basically, there’s nothing to do at home. That is, unless you’re
        Larry Walters. Because if you’re a 33 year old man and want to have a good time, all you really need is a lawn chair, 30 jugs of spring water, and 42 helium filled weather balloons. Oh yea, and also a bb gun because how else do you pop the weather balloons to get down? Larry wanted to fly, and he did what he wanted. He attached 42 balloons to a lawn chair, weighed himself down with 30 gallons of water, kept communication with
        his (extremely worried) girlfriend using a radio, and planned for the worst with a parachute. He was determined, and he did it.

        He planned to reach a maximum height of 7000 feet. He didn’t do that. He reached 16000 feet. Federal Airspace is considered around 500 feet and pretty soon the local authorities realized something was wrong, something was in the sky and it wasn’t a bird
        or a plane. It was a man with ambition and a willingness to live life the way he wanted, unbound by rules of society. A man who wanted to see earth from the sky, not through a window or a picture.

        It was cold up there, and Larry was getting sunburned. He already lost his glasses and dropped his bb gun after shooting out several balloons. He was drifting towards the Pacific Ocean and had to get down fast. Fortunately at 35 weather balloons he began to descend. Despite causing a 20-minute electricity
        blackout due to a balloon being caught in a power line, Larry landed safely and gave his lawn chair to a local kid. No kid in particular, just a local kid. <br/><br/> The Long Beach police department were waiting for Larry as he descended
        and immediately arrested him. The Federal Aviation Administration knew they had to discipline Larry in some way. But they simply didn’t know how. Something like this had never happened before. Eventually Larry would be charged with $1500 but received
        no jail time.

        Larry's life would see short term fame. He quit his job as a trucker and became in demand as a motivational speaker for a short duration. He appeared in a timex advertisement. He insipired several imitators seeking the skies via helium balloons. Despite
        this, he did not recieve significant amounts of money and nor should he expect to. He did this for himself and it was his experience to remember forever. But Larry's life eventually took a turn for the worst in the following decade. He had broken
        up with his girlfriend of 15 years and could only find work sporadically as a security guard. He volunteered for the United States Forest Service. At 44 he took his own life at the Angeles National Forest. There was no suicide note. <br/><br/>        Larry will go down in history as a representation of our inner desires, unbound by adulthood and societal expectations. According to Larry, he’d always wanted to fly using weather balloons since the age of 13 when he first saw them at a military
        surplus store. And 20 years later, he did it. Up in the sky, amazed by the view around him, Larry forgot to take a single picture with his camera. “It was one hell of a view” he said. Very few people were able to see the world the way Larry did.
        No windows, no pictures, no videos, just pure earth and sky, 16000 feet in the air.
